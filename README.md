# Automate-Infrastructure-with-IaC-using-Terraform
We have built AWS infrastructure for 2 websites manually, it is time to automate the process using Terraform.

Let us start building the same set up with the power of Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

## Prerequisites before you begin writing Terraform code

**Step 1.** 
You must have completed Terraform course to understand the core concept of the idea of IaC

**Step 2**
Create an IAM user, name it `terraform` (ensure that the user has only programatic access to your AWS account) and grant this user AdministratorAccess permissions.
Alright! Since you have an overview, we’ll proceed while filling in any gaps along the way.  
Terraform needs permissions to interact with AWS resources, so we’ll create an **IAM user** with programmatic access.  
1. **Log in to AWS Console** → Go to **IAM (Identity & Access Management)**.  

2. **Create a New User**:  
   - **User name:** `terraform`  
   - **Access type:** **Programmatic access** (checkbox should be selected).

3. **Attach Permissions:**  
   - Select **“Attach existing policies directly”**.  
   - Search for and attach **`AdministratorAccess`** policy (for learning purposes).

4. **Create the User** and **download the credentials file** or **copy**:  
   - **Access Key ID**  
   - **Secret Access Key**  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/98b29f7d-bdd2-4ff3-bea8-f953d21fef15)


**Step 3**
Configure programmatic access from your workstation to connect to AWS using the access keys copied above and a Python SDK (boto3). You must have Python 3.6 or higher on your workstation.

Got it. Here’s **Step 3 from the beginning**, as if you haven't done anything yet.  

---

# **Step 3: Configure AWS CLI for Programmatic Access**  

**3.1 Install AWS CLI on Windows**  
Since we need AWS CLI to configure programmatic access, let's install it first.  

1. Open **Git Bash** (or PowerShell)  
2. Run this command to download and install AWS CLI:  
   ```bash
   msiexec.exe /i https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.msi
   ```
3. Follow the installation prompts and complete the setup.

---

**3.2 Verify AWS CLI Installation**  
After installation, check if AWS CLI is installed correctly:  
```bash
aws --version
```  
✅ If successful, you should see output like this:  
```
aws-cli/2.x.x Python/x.x.x Windows/x.x.x exe/MSI
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b3a8b813-20d9-4e89-9164-ca77acb42b06)

 
❌ If you see **"command not found"**, restart your terminal and try again.  

---

### **3.3 Configure AWS CLI with Access Keys**  
Now, let's configure AWS CLI with your **IAM user’s access keys**.  

1. Run the following command:  
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```  
2. When prompted, enter:  
   - **AWS Access Key ID:** _(Paste the access key you copied from IAM)_  
   - **AWS Secret Access Key:** _(Paste the secret key)_  
   - **Default region name:** _(e.g., `us-east-1`, `eu-west-1`, or your preferred region)_  
   - **Default output format:** _(Press Enter to use `json` or type `table`/`text`)_  

---

### **3.4 Test AWS CLI Connection**  
Run this command to verify that AWS CLI can access your AWS account:  
```bash
aws s3 ls
```  
✅ If everything is configured correctly, you should see a list of your S3 buckets (or an empty response if no buckets exist).  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d7b2d692-f91b-42c7-a29d-d535d9aeab6a)

---

#### **3.4 Create an S3 Bucket**  
S3 bucket names must be **globally unique**, so choose a unique name.

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://your-unique-bucket-name --region us-east-1
```
For example:  
```bash
aws s3 mb s3://captainfresh090-dev-terraform-bucket --region us-east-1
```
If your region is different, replace `us-east-1` with the correct region.

---

#### **Step 4: Verify Bucket Creation**  
To check if the bucket was successfully created, list all your S3 buckets:  
```bash
aws s3 ls
```
You should see an output like this:  
```
2025-02-18 12:45:30 captainfresh090-dev-terraform-bucket
```

## The secrets of writing quality Terraform code

The secret recipe of a successful Terraform projects consists of:
* Your understanding of your goal (desired AWS infrastructure end state)
* Your knowledge of the IaC technology used (in this case – Terraform)
* Your ability to effectively use up to date Terraform documentation here

  
As you go along completing this project, you will get familiar with Terraform-specific terminology, such as:

* Attribute
* Resource
* Interpolations
* Argument
* Providers
* Provisioners
* Input Variables
* Output Variables
* Module
* Data Source
* Local Values
* Backend


Make sure you understand them and know when to use each of them.

Another concept you must know is data type. This is a general programing concept, it refers to how data represented in a programming language and defines how a compiler or interpreter can use the data. Common data types are:

* Integer
* Float
* String
* Boolean, etc.

## Best practices
* Ensure that every resource is tagged using multiple key-value pairs. You will see this in action as we go along.
* Try to write reusable code, avoid hard coding values wherever possible. (For learning purpose, we will start by hard coding, but gradually refactor our work to follow best practices).


Great! 🎉 Now that we've verified programmatic access, we can move on to the next step.

## Install Terraform (If You Haven't Already)
Run this command to verify Terraform is installed:
```bash
terraform -version
```
If it’s not installed, download and install Terraform from the [official Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).

**Installing Terraform on Windows**
Since you haven’t installed Terraform yet, follow these steps carefully.

---

### **Step 1: Download Terraform**
1. Go to the [official Terraform website](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads).  
2. Scroll down and select **Windows** as your OS.  
3. Download the **.zip** file for the latest version.

---

### **Step 2: Extract & Move Terraform**
1. Extract the **.zip** file to a location of your choice (e.g., `C:\terraform`).  
2. Copy the `terraform.exe` file inside the extracted folder.  
3. Move `terraform.exe` to a directory that’s in your **system PATH**, or add its location to PATH.

---

### **Step 3: Add Terraform to System PATH**
1. Open **File Explorer**, right-click on **This PC**, and select **Properties**.  
2. Click on **Advanced System Settings** → **Environment Variables**.  
3. Under **System Variables**, find and select **Path**, then click **Edit**.  
4. Click **New**, and paste the path where `terraform.exe` is located (e.g., `C:\terraform`).  
5. Click **OK** to save changes.

---

### **Step 4: Verify Terraform Installation**
1. Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** or **PowerShell**.  
2. Run the following command:  
   ```
   terraform -version
   ```
3. You should see output similar to:  
   ```
   Terraform v1.xx.x
   ```

## CREATING VPC | SUBNETS | SECURITY GROUPS

### **Step 1: Create the Terraform Directory & File**  
1. Open **VS Code**.  
2. Create a new folder named **`PBL`** (inside `C:\Users\PC\` or any preferred location).  
3. Inside the `PBL` folder, create a new file named **`main.tf`**.  

Great! Now, let's move to the next step.  

---

### **Step 2: Define the Provider & VPC in `main.tf`**  
1. Open `main.tf` in VS Code.  
2. Copy and paste the following Terraform code into the file:  

```
# Define AWS Provider
provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-central-1"  # Change this to your preferred AWS region
}

# Create a VPC
resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
  cidr_block                     = "172.16.0.0/16"
  enable_dns_support             = true
  enable_dns_hostnames           = true
}
```

3. **Save the file.**  

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8f919834-0f4f-4170-a634-14509b5a46d6)

---

### **Step 3: Initialize Terraform**  
1. Open **Terminal** in VS Code (press `Ctrl + ~` to open it).  

2. Navigate to your **PBL** folder (if you’re not already there):  
```bash
cd C:\Users\PC\PBL
```

3. Run the **terraform init** command to initialize the directory:  
```bash
terraform init
```

---

You should see something like this:  
```
Initializing the backend...
Initializing provider plugins...
- Finding latest version of hashicorp/aws...
- Installing hashicorp/aws vX.X.X...
- Installed hashicorp/aws vX.X.X...
Terraform has been successfully initialized!
```

---

### **Step 4: Run Terraform Plan**  
This command will analyze the `main.tf` file and show you what Terraform is about to create.

1. Run the following command in your **PBL** directory:  
```bash
terraform plan
```

2. Terraform will display a list of resources that will be created. It should include something like:
```
Terraform will perform the following actions:
  # aws_vpc.main will be created
  + resource "aws_vpc" "main" {
      + cidr_block = "172.16.0.0/16"
      + enable_dns_support = true
      + enable_dns_hostnames = true
      ...
    }
Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
```
This means Terraform has **recognized** your VPC configuration and is ready to deploy.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad0fd0b5-f80e-4463-84fc-481d9a647297)


---

Now that `terraform plan` is working fine, it's time to **apply** the changes and create the VPC.  

### **Next Step: Apply Terraform Configuration**
Run:  
```bash
terraform apply
```
Terraform will show you a summary of what it will create and ask for confirmation. Type **`yes`** when prompted.

---

- Terraform will create the **VPC** as defined in `main.tf`.
- A new file, `terraform.tfstate`, will be generated to track your infrastructure state.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/48d7e9d1-72e3-4614-a767-805e4de4c5c7)


Your VPC is now up and running. Let’s quickly verify:  

Run:  
```
terraform state list
```
This will show all the resources Terraform is managing. You should see your `aws_vpc.main` in the list.  

Then, you can double-check in the AWS console:  
- Go to **VPC Dashboard**  
- Click on **Your VPCs**  
- Look for a VPC with the CIDR block `172.16.0.0/16`

## Subnets resource section
According to our architectural design, we require 6 subnets:

* 2 public
* 2 private for webservers
* 2 private for data layer

* Let us create the first 2 public subnets by adding the following to the main.tf file: 

```
# Create public subnet1
resource "aws_subnet" "public1" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = "172.16.0.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1a"
}

# Create public subnet2
resource "aws_subnet" "public2" {
  vpc_id                  = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block              = "172.16.1.0/24"
  map_public_ip_on_launch = true
  availability_zone       = "us-east-1b"
}
```
- Run `terraform plan` to preview the changes.
- Run `terraform apply` to create the public subnets.

***Now we confirm this on the Console to see if it was created successfully***

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aa8d14fe-caab-4d11-82b9-a3aaad012fa2)
>We have successfully created two public subnets

## **Observations:**

* Hard coded values: Remember our best practice hint from the beginning? Both the availability_zone and cidr_block arguments are hard coded. We should always endeavour to make our work dynamic.
* Multiple Resource Blocks: Notice that we have declared multiple resource blocks for each subnet in the code. This is bad coding practice. We need to create a single resource block that can dynamically create resources without specifying multiple blocks. Imagine if we wanted to create 10 subnets, our code would look very clumsy. So, we need to optimize this by introducing a count argument.
First, destroy the current infrastructure. Since we are still in development, this is totally fine. Otherwise, DO NOT DESTROY an infrastructure that has been deployed to production.
